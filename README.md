# Booking for Vaccination

Just simple, yet amazing app.

## How it works?

App is made with Flutter.

Mobile App collects required data from user: 
  - Name & Surname
  - Phone Number
  - ID number
  - Place
  - Date & time(availability checked automatically in app)
 
 Then, when data is collected and confirmed, user will get SMS-confirmation.
 
 Here user must input required data:
